# Create a token
This Solidity program is a simple "MyToken" program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality like minting and burning of Token of the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to serve as an introduction to solidity and token mechanism on Ethereum blockchain.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity,which is used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a token named METACRAFTERS abbreviated as MTC. This program allows to mint , burn, and have the information about total supply and the balance of addressess of token. 
This program will serve as the gate to understanding and moving onto complex projects in solidity.
## Getting Started

### Executing program
use REmix - an online Solidity IDE , to execute the program
steps:
1) Create a New File: click on the"+" available on the left slidebar of the page and save the file with a .sol extension.
2) Paste the code given in  [https://github.com/encoded2203/meta_ethbeg/blob/main/READMEcode.md]
3) Compile the code: click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar and ensure e the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.9" and then click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.
4) Deploy and Contract: Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
5) Interact with the Contract:Once the contract is deployed, we can call mint and burn function by using address. Then click on the "transact" button to execute the function and retrieve the updated information.
